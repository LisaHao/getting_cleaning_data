The run_analysis.R file collects and cleans data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. As per assignment instructions, it completes the following:
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The resulting independent tiny data set is found in tidy_data.txt.
